# Analyzing Car Reviews with LLMs

Use pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve diverse language tasks for a car dealership company.

## Project Description

Prepare to leverage your practical skills by using pre-trained LLMs! In this project, you are an AI developer hired by an auto dealership company. 

Your task is to implement pre-trained large language model (LLM) use cases for tasks such as analyzing and classifying customer reviews on cars, responding to inquiries about available car models, and translating the company's English text data into other languages.

Car-ing is sharing, an auto dealership company for car sales and rental, is taking their services to the next level thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs). As their newly recruited AI and NLP developer, you've been asked to prototype a chatbot app with multiple functionalities that not only assist customers but also provide support to human agents in the company.

The solution should receive textual prompts and use a variety of pre-trained Hugging Face LLMs to respond to a series of tasks, such as:
- Classifying the sentiment in a carâ€™s text review.
- Answering a customer question.
- Summarizing or translating text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
